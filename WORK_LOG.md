| February 24  |  10:45-12:00pm  | I  thought about approaches to how to solve the problem set with the people at my table. We discussed implementing a tabulation style approach where we have a 2D array with both of the strings that we're comparing on the axes. Then when we add letters and we find the solution to the problem before that letter was added to be dynamic. |
| February 26  | 8:45 - 10:00 pm | I decided to implement a 2D array to keep track of how many of the same letters we have at each index in the two substrings. I traverse through this using past results to help find the new ones. If equal I plus 1 to what is diagonally before. If not I get the highest number up or down. Have a few errors still that I need to sort out. |

Made sure to properly implement max checking. Passed all test-cases.  |
